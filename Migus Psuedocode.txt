(Comment out MigusMovement's input for now)

MigusBrain: 
* Default: stands around for a random period of time
* Wander: chooses a random location, walks there (rotation decided by brain after destination reached).
** Can only be interrupted from this state if she notices a new leek (and doesn't ignore it).
** Wandering slightly increases tired gauge
* Lazy: sits on floor for a random period of time, facing a rotation
** Being lazy decreases her tired meter
** Chance of being lazy + time spent in lazy state depends on TiredPercentage. Migus may stay in Lazy state for longer if she is hungry + there are no leeks.
* Dance: picks a random song and dances. Chance of dancing increasing the less tired + hungry she is.
** Dancing increases her tired gauge.
* Curious: walks toward, then around a leek for a random time. Activated when Migus is not hungry and either a leek is placed, or she wanders near an already placed leek.
** If Migus is not hungry + in her "Lazy" state, she will not enter her "Curious" state.
** At the end of the "Curious" state, a random check is done to decide if Migus eats the leek or not. The chance of her eating is 0.45 * (1 + HungerPercentage)
** If Migus is not hungry, there is a random chance she will look at the leek but not walk towards it. This is determined by how many leeks were placed down in the last 3 minutes, Math.Min(leekList.Count - 5, 0) * 0.09. When this formula returns >= 1.0, Migus will no longer turn towards new leeks, completely ignoring them until the player stops placing so many leeks.
* Hungry: walks toward leek, contemplating for a short random time, then eats leek. Activated when Migus is hungry and either a leek is placed, or she wanders near an already placed leek.
** Eating leeks decreases her hunger meter.
** The hungrier Migus is, the less time she waits before eating.
** If hunger is below 30%, there is a 0% chance she will enter her "Hungry" phase when she sees a leek.
** If hunger is above 80%, there is a 100% chance she will enter her "Hungry" phase when she sees a leek.
** Between 30% and 80%, there is a HungerPercentage * 0.9 chance she will enter her "Hungry" phase when she sees a leek.
* Hunger gauge increases gradually over time. Hunger gauge increases a bit more every time Migus notices a new leek.

MigusBody: Only controls movement, rotation and animation of Migus (not monobehavior)
* Gets new destinations from brain
* Tells the brain when Migus has reached her current destination
* Changes migus animation based on state
* Moves head to look at leek if not curious + hungry and isn't fully ignoring leeks
* Doen't use MonoBehavior calls like Update()!!!!

MBFormulas: Static class with methods that calculate chances for each behavior/state occuring
